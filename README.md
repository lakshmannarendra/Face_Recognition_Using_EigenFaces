# Face Recognition using Eigenfaces and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This project implements a face recognition system using the **eigenfaces** method, leveraging **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction. The system uses a **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** classifier within the eigenface space to achieve efficient and accurate face recognition.

> For detailed graphs, explanations, and in-depth analysis, please refer to the [full report](https://github.com/lakshmannarendra/Face_Recognition_Using_EigenFaces/blob/main/report.pdf).

## Dataset

The project uses the **AT&T Face Dataset (ORL dataset)**, which contains 400 grayscale images of 40 individuals, with 10 images per individual. Download the dataset from [here](https://cam-orl.co.uk/facedatabase.html).

## Project Structure

- **Notebook**: A Jupyter Notebook that guides through each stage of data preprocessing, PCA application, and face recognition using k-NN.
- **Image Dataset**: ORL dataset, used to train and evaluate the face recognition model.

> **Note**: For a comprehensive explanation of each stage, including data preprocessing, PCA analysis, and model evaluation, check the [report](https://github.com/lakshmannarendra/Face_Recognition_Using_EigenFaces/blob/main/report.pdf).

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following libraries are installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scipy`

Install them with:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn scipy
```

## Project Overview

The project follows these main steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - The images are resized, converted to grayscale, and vectorized to prepare them for PCA.

2. **Normalization and Mean Face Calculation**
   - Calculates the mean face of the dataset, centering the data for PCA.

3. **PCA for Eigenface Computation**
   - PCA is applied to compute **eigenfaces**, capturing the main variations among faces in a lower-dimensional space.

4. **Projection into Eigenface Space**
   - Training and test images are projected into the eigenface space, simplifying their representation while retaining essential features for recognition.

5. **Face Recognition Using k-NN Classifier**
   - A k-NN classifier (with `k=1`) classifies images based on the nearest neighbor within the eigenface space.

6. **Real-Time Face Recognition**
   - The system processes and recognizes a new input image by projecting it into the eigenface space and matching it with known faces.

7. **Error Analysis**
   - Misclassifications, error rates, and the impact of varying train-test ratios are analyzed to refine the model's accuracy.

8. **Visualization**
   - Detailed graphs, including the mean face, eigenfaces, 3D projections, and error analysis plots, provide insights into model performance.

> **For detailed visualizations, scree plots, and explained variance graphs, refer to the [report](https://github.com/lakshmannarendra/Face_Recognition_Using_EigenFaces/blob/main/report.pdf).**

## Results

- **Accuracy**: The model achieved approximately **95% accuracy**.
- **Challenges**: Some difficulties were observed in differentiating similar-looking faces and under varying lighting conditions.
- **Future Improvements**: The report suggests exploring **deep learning** techniques (e.g., CNNs) and advanced preprocessing to improve robustness and accuracy.
